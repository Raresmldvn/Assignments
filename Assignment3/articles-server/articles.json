Before the March attack he was believed to have been living in the West Midlands.\n\nHe had a criminal past but his most recent conviction, for possessing a knife, was in December 2003. He had never been convicted of a terrorism offence.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May told MPs that while Masood had been \"once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism\" he was a \"peripheral figure\" and \"not part of the current intelligence picture\".\n\nAfter his birth, Masood was registered in the Dartford district of Kent, but his name was given as Adrian Russell Elms.\n\nTwo years later, his mother married a man with the name Ajao and, as a child, Masood was known as Adrian Russell Ajao. He later used both Ajao and Elms until he converted to Islam and became Masood.\n\nMasood spent a number of years working in Saudi Arabia teaching English as a second language at the General Authority of Civil Aviation in the port city of Jeddah, the BBC understands.","relatedArticles":[]},{"title":"Avengers: Infinity War behind the scenes ","articleAbstract":"With the release of Avengers: Infinity War drawing ever closer, Marvel and Disney going all-out and releasing dozens of new teases.","author":{"name":"Deleted","email":null,"password":null,"admin":false},"body":"nfinity War, which marks the culmination of 10 years of Marvel movies, has already set records — the first full trailer quickly became the most-watched trailer within 24 hours ever. \n\nAmerican ticket sellers Fandango say the Russo Brothers-directed movie has already sold more presale tickets than the last seven Marvel movies combined – that includes Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\n\nHalf an hour of footage was recently shown to the public, the reaction being overwhelmingly positive.","relatedArticles":[]},{"title":"Seven Children Draw Their Perfect Day","articleAbstract":"Their illustrations feature everything from friendly sharks and a day at 'Jurassic World' to harmony along the US-Mexico border and faster public transportation.","author":{"name":"Raresmldvn","email":"raresmldvn@yahoo.com","password":"rares","admin":false},"body":"Some people spend a significant portion of their time imagining what would need to happen in order for everything to make more sense and let them enjoy life more. Sometimes, we devote so much energy to these possible scenarios that we allow real life to pass us by, which means we inevitably miss the little episodes that—when we add them up—could give us the fulfillment we so desire.
